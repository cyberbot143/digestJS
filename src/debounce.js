/ debounce function that will wrap our event
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  // maintain a timer
  let timer = null;
  // closure function that has access to timer
  return function() {
    // get the scope and parameters of the function 
    // via 'this' and 'arguments'
    let context = this;
    let args = arguments;
    // if event is called, clear the timer and start over
    clearTimeout(timer);

      fn.apply(context, args);

// function to be called when user scrolls
function foo() {
  console.log('You are scrolling!');
}

// wrap our function in a debounce to fire once 2 seconds have gone by
let elem = document.getElementById('container');
elem.addEventListener('scroll', debounce(foo, 2000));

/*

Throttling is another technique thatâ€™s is similar to debouncing, except that instead of
waiting for some time to pass by before calling a function, throttling just spreads 
the function calls across a longer time interval. So if an event occurs 10 times within
100 milliseconds, throttling could spread out each of the function calls to be executed 
once every 2 seconds instead of all firing within 100 milliseconds.
